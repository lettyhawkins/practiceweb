Learn a new skill
This is the first time I am a part of a team project. I usually work independent. I want to build a new website for a non=profit Hispanic Christian radio station. I don't know how to begin, since I don't know how to build a website with code only:( 
Anyone out there who can help. I would like for website to contain the following tabs:  HOME / SERMONS/ ON-AIR/ ABOUT US /CONTACT US
